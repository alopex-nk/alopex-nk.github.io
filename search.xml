The demonstration of topology in strong light–matter coupling regimes may prove tunable optical devices that are immune to disorder and defects or achieve the extreme light confinement. Recently, the topological properties of exciton–polaritons were experimentally studied in deep cryogenic temperatures. As for another elementary quasiparticle in solids, phonon–polaritons, which can remain stable at a high temperature, the relative topological dispersion contours have been observed very recently at room temperatures. Here, we experimentally presented a topological valley transport of terahertz phonon–polaritons in LiNbO<sub>3</sub> photonic crystal slab. Topological waveguides with two peculiar interfaces are designed and studied, where the phonon–polaritons are generated through femtosecond laser pulses. We show the intensity distribution and dispersion curves of phonon–polaritons propagating in the topological waveguides at different bended interfaces, in which the topological edge modes make smooth detours. Our work opened a new path toward topological polaritonics at a valley-edge-mode based phonon–polariton platform, which also provides insights to the low loss phonon–polariton chips, strong light–matter interactions, nonlinear topological photonics, and future THz communications.</p><p>论文信息：</p><ul><li><p>August 2021, ACS Photonics XX, XX</p></li><li><p>DOI: <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsphotonics.1c00860">10.1021/acsphotonics.1c00860</a></p></li></ul>]]></content>

Traditionally, the optical nonlinearity for a light wave at frequencies beyond near-infrared is observed with very high peak intensity, as in most materials only the electronic nonlinearity dominates while ionic contribution is negligible. However, it was shown that the ionic contribution to nonlinearity can be much larger than the electronic one in microwave experiments. In the terahertz (THz) regime, phonon polariton may assist to substantially trigger the ionic nonlinearity of the crystals, so as to enhance even more the nonlinear optical susceptibility. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a giant second-order optical nonlinearity at THz frequency, orders of magnitude higher than that in the visible and microwave regimes. Different from previous work, the phonon-light coupling is achieved under a phase-matching setting, and the dynamic process of nonlinear THz generation is directly observed in a thin-film waveguide using a time-resolved imaging technique. Furthermore, a nonlinear modification to the Huang equations is proposed to explain the observed nonlinearity enhancement. This work brings about an effective approach to achieve high nonlinearity in ionic crystals, promising for applications in THz nonlinear technologies.</p><p>论文信息：</p><ul><li><p>May 2021, Nature Communications 12(1):3183</p></li><li><p>DOI: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23526-w">10.1038/s41467-021-23526-w</a></p></li></ul>]]></content>

      <title>Observation of “Frozen‐Phase” Propagation of THz Pulses in a Dispersive Optical System</title>

So far, a variety of techniques have been proposed and demonstrated to compensate the second‐order (group‐velocity) dispersion, such as dispersion management and nonlinear soliton formation, yet it is commonly believed that the first‐order dispersion (FOD) is less amenable and cannot be eliminated. In this work, it is shown that a phase‐invariant propagation of THz pulses, namely the “frozen‐phase” propagation, can be realized by a complete cancellation of the FOD, achieved by implementing a synchronized THz moving source with a locked initial phase. The dynamic generation and propagation process of the THz pulses is examined directly by a time‐resolved imaging system. To the best of authors’ knowledge, this represents the first demonstration of the “frozen‐phase” propagation of a light pulse in dispersive optical systems. Spatiotemporal propagation of light pulses in dispersive systems always suffer a severe phase variation. Here, the authors demonstrate a “frozen‐phase” propagation of THz pulses in subwavelength waveguide through a complete cancellation of first‐order dispersion. This is the first time “soliton‐like” propagation pulses are shown by a linear technique work on phase.</p><p>论文信息：</p><ul><li>May 2021，Laser &amp; Photonics Reviews 202000591</li><li>DOI: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lpor.202000591">10.1002/lpor.202000591</a></li></ul>]]></content>
